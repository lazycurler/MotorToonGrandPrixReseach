# Motor Toon Grand Prix Research
Reverse engineering and documenting interesting parts of Motor Toon Grand Prix for the PS1

**DISCLAIMER!**

* All scripts were written to further the research and are not, themselves, the end product.
* They likely exist solely to solve one-off problems and were quickly (re)written in an attempt to better understand or explain observed in-game phenomenon.
* Almost assuredly any code in this repo is is not reuseable, maintainable, or even well documented.
* That being said, please feel free to ask questions or open a PR ;)
